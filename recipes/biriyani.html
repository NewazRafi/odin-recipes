    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a popular and flavorful South Asian dish known for its aromatic and spiced 
        rice preparation. It typically consists of long-grain basmati rice cooked with a 
        variety of ingredients such as meat (usually chicken, lamb, or goat), vegetables, or 
        seafood. The rice is layered with marinated meat or vegetables and infused with a 
        blend of spices, including cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves.</p>

    <p>The cooking process often involves saut√©ing the ingredients, parboiling the rice, 
        and then layering them in a pot or cooking vessel. Saffron-infused milk or food 
        coloring is often used to give the rice a vibrant hue. Biryani is cooked on a low 
        flame, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to absorb the rich aromas. 
        It's typically garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs like mint and cilantro, and 
        sometimes served with yogurt-based raita or a side salad.</p>
        
    <p>Biryani variations can be found throughout South Asia, each with its own regional 
        flavors and ingredients. It's a beloved and cherished dish that's known for its 
        delicious blend of spices and textures, making it a favorite in many parts of the 
        world.

            <h3>Prepare the Rice:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash and soak the basmati rice for 30 minutes, then drain it.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, bring water or broth to a boil</li>
                <li>Parboil the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (it should still have a slight 
                    bite)</li>
                <li>Drain and set aside.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani vessel, start by adding a layer of

                <li>Cook on low heat (simmer) for about 20-30 minutes. This is called "dum

                <li>Gently fluff the layers with a fork, mixing them if desired</li>
